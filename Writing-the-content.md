When writing the content, there are some things to take into account:

**Markdown syntax**

We work with a text format called MarkDown. You can learn about it from the link https://dip.torproject.org/help/user/markdown 

**Links**

Links are better done as \[linked words\](https://link), as it is easier to review them and simpler to read.

**HTML**

HTML is supported but not totally, and should be avoided. It is better to stick to MarkDown.

**TABLES**

You can do tables with | characters. Example:

```
| Project  | Methodology | Locations | Dates | Reporting |
| -------- | ----------- | --------- | ----- | --------- |
|  |  |  |  | test      |
```

Will create:

| Project  | Methodology | Locations | Dates | Reporting |
| -------- | ----------- | --------- | ----- | --------- |
|  |  |  |  | test      |
