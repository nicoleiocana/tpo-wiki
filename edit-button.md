Some lektor-based websites have an **edit button** that you can use to submit small corrections:

![edit_button](uploads/e642ffb9a92198a1ca9e72c1dd2dcba1/edit_button.png)

You will be presented with the file that generates the page:

![contents-page](uploads/b8584e3d77dbcb2cbce60bd82cba36c1/contents-page.png)

Once you have made your changes, change the title and description of them to make it more descriptive (add the ticket link if there is any)
