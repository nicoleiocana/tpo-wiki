Some lektor-based websites have an **edit button** that you can use to submit small corrections:

![edit_button](uploads/e642ffb9a92198a1ca9e72c1dd2dcba1/edit_button.png)

You will be presented with the file that generates the page:

![contents-page](uploads/b8584e3d77dbcb2cbce60bd82cba36c1/contents-page.png)

Once you have made your changes:

* change the title and description of them to make it more descriptive (add the ticket full URL if there is any).
  Remember that the first lines are the ones appearing on the git log, try to give a short explanation of why you did the change.
  Please don't leave it as 'Updated contents.lr' as that does not give a real idea of what you wanted to do.
  Same goes to the branches called 'patch-1'. Let yourself go! be creative!
* Create a pull request for your contribution to be reviewed.
* If there is a ticket, mention the pull request on the comments.
